# Surf-Co
Assignment 2 in the course Dynamic Web Applications.

## Background of the website
Kim and Emmy love everything that has to do with surfing and have opened a surf shop on the beach where they sell and rent surfboards but also arrange courses. They have a website that is up and running and need help creating the feeling of freedom and adventure on the website.

## Task
Based on a finished HTML document, build a design for a responsive web page with modern CSS techniques.

## Requirements
You must create a well-thought-out and well-made design and layout that suits the content in terms of color, typography, design and layout.

This means that you have to make careful choices regarding:
* the color of text and backgrund
* typography in terms of font, font size, etc.
* layout - Should it be fixed or floating? How should the elements be placed on the page?

You should use either CSS Normalize or CSS Reset.

You are expected to write proper code that is easy to read and where you take control of your design by not only working with the default settings.

You MUST make sure that the CSS file validates correctly according to the W3C standard (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

### Responsiveness
The website should be built with a responsive design that utilizes the screen space and looks good for all widths on the viewport between 640px and 1280px.

* This means that you must use media queries with at least one breakpoint
* You must work with at least one of _float_, _position_, _flexbox_ and / or _grid_.
